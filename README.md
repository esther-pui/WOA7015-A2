## ðŸŒŸ Task Summary

1.  **From Scratch (NumPy):** Implement six functions for a Logistic Regression model from scratch using **NumPy** to train on the toy data.
2.  **Benchmark (PyTorch):** Use **PyTorch** built-in functions to train and test the same model.
3.  **Analysis:** Compare the two model's testing accuracies in a report.

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation: Six Mandatory Functions

The custom model is built by implementing the core optimization steps of **Gradient Descent** manually. The six required functions handle the entire training and testing lifecycle:

| # | Function Name | Mathematical Role |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `CalcObj` | Calculates **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** |
| **2** | `CalcGrad` | Calculates the **Gradient** |
| **3** | `UpdateParams` | Updates the **Weights** |
| **4** | `CheckConvg` | Determines **Convergence** |
| **5** | `GradientDescent` | The **Main Training Loop** |
| **6** | `PredictLabels` | Calculates **Test Predictions & Errors** |

The entire project is contained within an **iPython Notebook (`.ipynb`)**.

1.  **Environment:** Use **Google Colab** (recommended) or a local Jupyter setup.
2.  **Data:** Ensure `Train_toydata.txt` and `Test_toydata.txt` are available in the execution environment.
3.  **Execution:** Run all cells sequentially to perform data preparation, custom training, PyTorch benchmarking, and final report generation.
